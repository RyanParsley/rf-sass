## Summary
### There's more to it than nesting

Note:
On the topic of preprocessors, we know they "add variables" and
"nesting"... I want to talk about features that I find more
interesting (while still staying at a high level).

Introduce the topics to be covered. I think I'll describe the difference
between mixins, extend, variables, functions.
