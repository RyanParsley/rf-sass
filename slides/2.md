## CSS is a blunt tool
### Sass enables elegance

Note:
Sass doesn't make css render any better on IE. However, it can make this
less painful.

Sass doesn't make your website more or less performant. It provides you
with plenty of rope to do with as you will.

*It **simply** enables you to do things differently.*

There's less magic when you see what gets rendered.
